# Project Brief: [Project Name]

**Purpose:** Core project definition, goals, scope, and success metrics
**Status:** Production-ready template - customize for your client/project
**Template Updated:** November 10, 2025 (PR #9 - MBIE extraction complete)

## Project Overview

### What is This Project?

This is a **consulting deployment toolkit** combining Memory-Bank documentation framework with MBIE (Memory-Bank Intelligence Engine) semantic search. Clone this template to your client's environment and customize it for their specific business transformation needs.

For your client: [Provide 1-2 paragraph description of their project - what it is, what it does, who it serves]

### Why Does This Project Exist?

**Problem Statement:**
Business founders/operators often get trapped in operational bottlenecks, spending disproportionate time on manual, repetitive processes instead of strategic growth. Without systematic documentation and automation, these time drains compound and prevent delegation.

**Solution Approach:**
This toolkit combines two powerful components:
1. **Memory-Bank**: AI-optimized documentation framework that captures business processes
2. **MBIE**: Semantic search engine that identifies automation opportunities in documented processes

Together, they enable rapid business intelligence discovery and transformation planning.

**Value Proposition:**
For your client: [Describe the unique value this template provides for their specific business]
Template value: Production-ready framework proven to deliver 80-90% founder time reduction through systematic documentation + AI-powered discovery (validated: SleekAI case study: 5 hrs/week → 30 min/week, 230+ hours annually reclaimed)

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals (Template + Client Customization)

1. **Capture Business Context in Memory-Bank**
   - **Description:** Document client's business processes, objectives, constraints, and success metrics in the memory-bank system
   - **Success Metric:** Complete memory-bank customization with all placeholder values replaced
   - **Target:** Completed before MBIE deployment

2. **Identify Automation Opportunities via MBIE**
   - **Description:** Use semantic search to analyze documented processes and identify automation opportunities ranked by ROI
   - **Success Metric:** Top 5-10 automation opportunities identified with time savings estimates
   - **Target:** Complete within 1-2 hours of MBIE indexing and querying

3. **Deliver Transformation Plan & ROI Calculation**
   - **Description:** Convert MBIE findings into actionable transformation roadmap with implementation prioritization
   - **Success Metric:** Approved transformation plan with measurable time-savings targets
   - **Target:** Delivered before on-site implementation sprint
