# Plans - Future Work & Proposals

**Purpose**: Document planned features, experiments, and proposals before they become active work.
**Audience**: Product, engineering, stakeholders.

## Plan Lifecycle

### States
1. **Proposal** → Initial idea, seeking feedback
2. **Approved** → Greenlit for development
3. **In Progress** → Moved to activeContext.md
4. **Completed** → Moved to features/
5. **Abandoned** → Moved to archive/ with rationale

### Plan Template
Use `plan-template.md` for new proposals.

## Current Plans

### Approved Plans
*No approved plans yet - add your first plan!*

### Proposals Under Review

## Relationship to activeContext.md

**activeContext.md**: Current sprint/active work (next 2 weeks)
**plans/**: Future work (2 weeks to 6 months out)

**Workflow**:
1. Create proposal in `/plans/proposal-feature-name.md`
2. Get approval from stakeholders
3. When work starts → Move key details to `activeContext.md`
4. When complete → Create full docs in `features/`
5. Archive the original plan document
