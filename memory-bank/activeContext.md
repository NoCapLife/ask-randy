## Template Usage Instructions

**When setting up for your project:**

1. **Delete these template instructions** after reading
2. **Customize all bracketed placeholders** with your actual content
3. **Establish update rhythm** aligned with project cadence
4. **Remember Dual-Update Rule**: Update ceo-dashboard.md simultaneously when status changes
5. **Keep strategic**: Focus on "why" and "how", not just "what"
6. **Reference related docs**: Link to feature docs, technical specs, and progress tracking

**Dual-Update Rule (MANDATORY):**
When project status changes, update BOTH:
- `ceo-dashboard.md` - Operational view (Status → Next Action → Owner → Blockers)
- `activeContext.md` - Strategic view (Context, progress, decisions, rationale)

This ensures operational and strategic views stay synchronized.
